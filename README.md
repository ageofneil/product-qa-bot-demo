# A Basic Bot that Answers Product Questions

This app is a basic demo of an AI-driven product Q&A system, inspired by Amazon's AI assistant on product pages. It allows users to ask product-related questions and receive AI-generated responses based on pre-trained data.

### How It Works**
1. **Uses the Product ID to Define the Search Space**  
   When a user is browsing a product page, the app uses its **product ID** to filter the search space. 

2. **Searches User Query for the Best Match**  
   The app takes the userâ€™s question, converts it into an embedding, and searches for the most relevant match within the FAQ dataset specific to the product ID.  

3. **Generates & Outputs a Response**  
   - If a close match is found, a **contextual response** based on available information is given, helping guide the user toward relevant details. 
   - If no close match exists, the app provides the **pre-written answer**.
